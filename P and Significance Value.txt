How do you know if a p-value is statistically significant?

A p-value, or probability value, is a number describing how likely it is that your data would have occurred by random chance (i.e. that the null hypothesis is true).

The level of statistical significance is often expressed as a p-value between 0 and 1. 
The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis.

->A p-value less than 0.05 (typically â‰¤ 0.05) is statistically significant. 
It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is less than a 5% probability the null is correct (and the results are random). 
Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis.
However, if the p-value is below your threshold of significance (typically p < 0.05), 
you can reject the null hypothesis, but this does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the alternative hypothesis is true. 
The p-value is conditional upon the null hypothesis being true, but is unrelated to the truth or falsity of the alternative hypothesis.

->A p-value higher than 0.05 (> 0.05) is not statistically significant and indicates strong evidence for the null hypothesis. 
This means we retain the null hypothesis and reject the alternative hypothesis. 

You should note that you cannot accept the null hypothesis, we can only reject the null or fail to reject it.
A statistically significant result cannot prove that a research hypothesis is correct (as this implies 100% certainty).
